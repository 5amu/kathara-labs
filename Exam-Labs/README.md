# Exam-Labs
Here we collect all the network scenarios used for the practical exams of the course "Internet and Data Centers" at

For each scenario you can find a `.pdf` file containing the exam's text and the relative solution. 

Not all the solutions are provided. If you have the missing ones, please make a Pull Request! :smile:
