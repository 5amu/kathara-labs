# SDN - Openflow

This section includes network scenarios about SDN and Openflow.

The Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm aims at achieving the flexibility of the software in the provisioning of
new network services. The key idea is to decouple the network services from the underlying hardware.

[OpenFlow](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFlow) is the most used protocol for communication from the controller and the forwarding data
plane. It introduces a standard way to control switch/routers.

The [pox](pox) directory contains network scenarios implemented using POX, a Python based SDN Controller,
mainly used for teaching and research.
