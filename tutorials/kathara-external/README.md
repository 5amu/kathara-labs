# Kathar치 External - Tutorials (Linux Only)

The Kathar치 External feature allows the outsource of collision domains to external networks by sending network traffic 
created by devices to the host's physical interfaces. In this way, it is possible to connect a physical device to a 
Kathar치 network scenario, enabling a variety of use cases (e.g., testing of a real device configuration). 

**This feature is available only on Linux systems while using Docker as virtualization manager.**  

The following tutorials show simple examples on how to correctly configure Kathar치 External. 

* [Base configuration](base-configuration)
* [External using VLANs](vlan-configuration)
* [Communicating with the host](communicating-with-the-host)
